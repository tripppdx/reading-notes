# Ethics in Tech

## ETHICS IN THE WORKPLACE:

In the Gizmodo article, “Google Backtracks, Says Its AI Will Not Be Used for Weapons or Surveillance,” we see the positive impact that ethics in the workplace can have. Google employees and external academics protested Google’s involvement with Project Maven, a government pilot program that would use AI to analyze drone footage and defensive weaponry. After the pressure employees placed on Google, they have created a set of standards with the work they will do with governments to aid in the development of autonomous weapons systems. They also pulled out of Project Maven, which I agree is the right thing to do. One of the main tenets of the code of ethics is to do no harm. I am impressed that some employees risked losing their jobs to ensure the company is ethical.

## ETHICS IN TECHNOLOGY:

In the PhysOrg article, “The Cybersecurity Risks of Self-Driving Cars,” the author interviews a systems security expert about the risks of hacking self-driving vehicles. The article brings up good points about how hacks could break the rules of ethics and could cause harm if they are able to hack self-driving vehicles. I agree that this has a huge potential for ethical issues and needs to be regulated better. What struck me most was when the author asked the expert if she would ride in a self-driving vehicle and the answer was no. She brought up a good point that a death has already occured in a self-driving Tesla.
