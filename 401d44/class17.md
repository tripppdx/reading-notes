## Readings: AWS: S3 and Lambda

### 1. Describe “The Cloud”

The cloud is an abstraction that refers to the software and hardware that provides remote computing resources for client access.

### 2. What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?

A container consists of an entire runtime environment: an application, plus all its dependencies, libraries and other binaries, and configuration files needed to run it, bundled into one package. It can also refer to the hardware resources (memory, cpu, storage) allocated to this environment

### 3. What is auto-scaling?

Auto-scaling refers to the dynamic adjustment of compute resources provided to an application based on load.

### 4. What is bandwidth?

Bandwidth refers to the maximum amount of data that can be transmitted over a connection in a given time.

### 5. How do cloud providers compute service costs?

In general, cloud providers compute service costs based on some combination of the storage, bandwidth, and compute power an application consumes are some. For example, AWS bases it's fees largely on requests for S3 and compute time for EC2.

#### Cloud Services

The term "cloud services" refers to a wide range of services delivered on demand to companies and customers over the internet.

#### Cloud Architecture

Cloud architecture defines the technology components that are combined to build a cloud, where resources are pooled through virtualization technology and shared across a network. The components of a cloud architecture include:

- A front-end platform (the client or device used to access the cloud)
- One or more back-end platforms (servers and storage)
- A cloud-based delivery methodology
- A network to connect cloud clients, servers, and storage

#### AWS

AWS stands for Amazon Web Services. It is Amazon's cloud computing platform.

#### EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku

EC2/Beanstalk and Heroku provide similar services. Heroku can be more expensive, but is easier to configure.
