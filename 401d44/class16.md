### 1. Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle

The web request response cycle decribes the general flow of information on the internet. This flow follows the following path:

1. User gives a client a URL.
2. Client builds a request.
3. Client Sends request to server.
4. Serve receives request and builds aresponse.
5. The response is sent back to the client.

#### Pub/Sub

Publish/subscribe messaging, or pub/sub messaging, is a form of asynchronous service-to-service communication used in serverless and microservices architectures. In a pub/sub model, any message published to a topic is immediately received by all of the subscribers to the topic. Pub/sub messaging can be used to enable event-driven architectures, or to decouple applications in order to increase performance, reliability and scalability.
