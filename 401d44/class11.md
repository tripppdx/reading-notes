### Readings: Event Driven Applications

#### 1. Why is access control important?

Access control keeps confidential information, including customer data, personally identifiable information, and intellectual property, from falling into the wrong hands. Without a robust access control policy, organizations risk data leakage from both internal and external sources.

#### 2. Describe an application that would need access control.

Canvas is and example of an application that needs access control.

#### 3. What is a role used for?

A role in RBAC refers to the level of access that a user has to a protected resource.

#### 4. Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?

Mandatory Access Control (MAC) is a top down information security paradigm that assigns allows access to resources based upon a combination of the user's identity and the security labels assigned to an object.

Discretionary Access Control (DAC) is a decentralized security paradigm that puts access control in the hands of the user than owns the shared object.

RBAC is more scalable because it requires less administrative overhead than either MAC or DAC while limiting the user's discretion to indiscriminately share access.

#### Define the following terms:

##### Authorization

Authorization is concerned with whether a user whose identity has been verified had the rights to access a protected resource.

##### Role Based Access Control

Access control based on user roles (i.e., a collection of access authorizations a user receives based on an explicit or implicit assumption of a given role). Role permissions may be inherited through a role hierarchy and typically reflect the permissions needed to perform defined functions within an organization. A given role may apply to a single individual or to several individuals.

##### Capabilities

A set of mutually reinforcing security controls implemented by technical, physical, and procedural means. Such controls are typically selected to achieve a common information security-related purpose.
