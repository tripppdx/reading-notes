#### Trees - terminology

| Term        | Definition                                                                                       |

| node        | basic component of a tree that contains a value and pointers to other nodes                      |
| root        | node at the beginning of the tree, cannot be the child of any other node                         |
| k           | the number of children allowed per node                                                          |
| left        | in a binary tree, this refers one of the two possible nodes, the other being the right node      |
| right       | in a binary tree, this refers one of the two possible nodes, the other being the left node       |
| edge        | the pointer between nodes                                                                        |
| leaf        | a node with no children                                                                          |
| height      | number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf (all nodes are not required to have children) |
| binary tree | tree where node can only have up to two children                                                 |
| k-ary tree  | tree where node have more up to more than two children                                           |
| child       | node refernced by a pointer in another node closer to the root of the tree                       |
