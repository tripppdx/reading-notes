### 2. Whatâ€™s the difference between a framework and a library?

Frameworks and libraries both consist of reusable code that is written by third parties. The main difference between the two is in terms of "inversion control". With a library, the developer is in charge of applicatio flow and uses the libary to perform discrete tasks. With a framework, the framework controls application flow and the developer provides code that plugs in to the framework and gets called when needed.
