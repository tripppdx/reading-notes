The author, Anthony Moore, argues that one should place a high value on one's time. He suggests a mental exercise where you pretend that your time is worth $1000/hour. It is his belief that this should inspire you to be more productive. He also conflates being busy with wasting effort. He is, in fact, simply arguing that you shouldn't fritter your time away on meaningless tasks that don't contribute to your strategic objectives.

#### Getting to the Root of a Problem Quickly

The 5 whys (5Y) is a problem solving method in which root causes and determined ny asking "Why?" five times. It uses counter-measures rather than solutions (treating the symptoms) to prevent a problem from happening again. The model uses a seven-step process.

```plaintext
1. Assemble a team
2. Define the problem
3. Ask the first "why"
4. Ask "why" four more times
5. Know when to stop
6. Address the root causes
7. Monitor your measures
```
