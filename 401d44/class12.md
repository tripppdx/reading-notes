### Readings: Socket.io

#### 1. What is the benefit of transforming data into packets?

Transforming data into packets allows more computers to more efficiently share the same bandwidth (one does not have to wait until another is finished with a long message before communictaion). Packets can also adapt to changing network conditions and take the most efficient path to their destination.

#### 2. UDP is often refereed to as a connectionless protocol. Why is this?

With UDP, a connection does not need to established between the source and destination before data is transmitted. Data is sent as soon as it's ready and assumes the endpoint will receive it. It expects expects the application to put the data back together instead of the protocol.

#### 3. Can a socket server application have multiple socket connections?

Yes.

#### 4. Can a socket connection application be connected to multiple socket servers?

Yes.

#### 5. Can an application be both a socket server and a socket connection?

Yes.
