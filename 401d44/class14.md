## CascadiaJS Day Two (11/04/2021)

### What were the topics you encountered during the conference?

Today I attended two workshops. These were presented by Dolby.io and Hasura, respectively. The Dolby.io workshop focused on their communications API's. The Hasura workshop highlighted their product which is a GraphQL engine and toolset for creating GraphQL CRUD APIs over Postgres.

### Who where the speakers / organizations that you experienced during the conference?

The Dolby.io workshop was presented by Dan Zeitman, Jayson Delancey, Jessica Zhu, and Braden Riggs. The Hasura workshop was presented by Gavin Ray.

### What techniques did you learn / what to learn more about?

Technologies I learned about today that most interested me were GraphQL, Next.js, and TypeScript. The funniest thing about CascadiaJS is that it convinced me I should ditch JS for TypeScript. Maybe next year should be the first year of CascadiaTS!

### Share any project you created during any workshops you attented!

The Dolby.io 'project' consisted of cloning repos and delpoying them to Netlify to demonstrate their API in a video conferencing application. I could not participate fully in the Hasura project because the demo depended on a paid subscription to Github Codespaces or mastery of Docker. At any rate, it was largely just a demo of using Hasura with Next.js and Typescript to build a Postgres backed API.
