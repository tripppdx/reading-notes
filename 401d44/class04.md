# Data Modeling

## Readings

### 1. Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development

1. Helps programmers understand their code.

2. Clarify requirements.

3. Mistakes are caught almost immediately.

### 2. In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?

Before and after each test in a given test suite to spy on the console with consoleSpy.

### 3. What is one downside of Test Driven Development

The tests can be hard to write and slowdown development.

### functional programming

#### object-oriented programming (OOP)

The use of a class of programming languages and techniques based on the concept of an "object" which is a data structure (abstract data type) encapsulated with a set of routines, called "methods", which operate on the data.

#### class

The prototype for an object in an object-oriented language

#### super

The super keyword is used to access and call functions on an object's parent.

#### this

The 'this' keyword refers to the object it belongs to

#### Test Driven Development (TDD)

Test Driven Development is a software development methodology whereby you write and run a set of tests before you write code

#### Jest

Testing suite

#### Continuous Integration (CI)

A process by which developers continually commit code in small increments which is automatically built and tested before being pushed to the shared repo.

#### REST

Representational State Transfer

#### Data Model

A data model defines what information is contained in a database, how the information will be used, and how the items in the database will be related to each other
